# 1. How to Get Help
There are three ways to get help if anything goes wrong with the course:

1. Post in the QA discussion here on Udemy. I usually only answer questions once a day during week days only.
2. Email me at ste.grider@gmail.com. I will usually get you a response back within 24 hours
3. Message me on Udemy. Like email, I'll usually get you a response back within 24 hours

# 2. Course Resources
* Completed examples can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts)
* Diagrams can be viewed on diagrams.net with downloaded xlm files

# 4. Environment Setup
* Install Go from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)

# 5. VSCode Installation
* First, just run `go` to make sure you see the help message pop up. This means Go was installed successfully
* Install VSCode
* lol okay done

# 6. Go Support in VSCode
* i.e. extensions B)
* Install [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)
* Make sure the extension installed correctly
  * This part seems to be outdated
* I might encounter some errors later on; sounds like a future me problem
