# 1. How to Get Help

There are three ways to get help if anything goes wrong with the course:

1. Post in the QA discussion here on Udemy. I usually only answer questions once a day during week days only.
2. Email me at ste.grider@gmail.com. I will usually get you a response back within 24 hours
3. Message me on Udemy. Like email, I'll usually get you a response back within 24 hours
